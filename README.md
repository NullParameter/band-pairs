# Problem

Given an input file, where each line consists of a comma separated list of band names, 
find each pair of bands that occurs twice on a single line at least fifty times throughout
the input file.  Then output those pairs of bands to another file.

# Solution

 


# How to Run

Code can be executed through Gradle from the root directory of the project, supplying both the input and output filepaths, like so:
`./gradlew run -Pinput="src/main/resources/input.txt" -Poutput="test.csv"`
